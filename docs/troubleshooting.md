# Troubleshooting Visual Studio Live Share

This article covers troubleshooting tips, workarounds, and answers for common problems and questions. You may also want to take a look at the [FAQ](faq.yml). 

## Installation / tool requirements

The following are troubleshooting tips related to installing Visual Studio Live Share.

| Tool | Problem | Resolution / Workaround |
|------|---------|------------|
|VS Code <strong>(macOS)</strong>| A warning appears telling you your <strong>macOS is not supported anymore by .NET Core <strong>| This warning appears is due to a recent [update made by .NET Core](/dotnet/core/install/dependencies?tabs=netcore31&pivots=os-macos) that no longer supports any versions lower than <strong>High Sierra (10.13+).</strong> To enable the Live Share extension, please update your OS.
| VS | The extension installer <strong>cannot find a version of Visual Studio</strong> to use when trying to install the Visual Studio Live Share extension. | Visual Studio Live Share requires **Visual Studio 2017 version 15.6** or higher for both hosts and guests. Install the latest stable [update of Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.com/vs/) and retry. |
| VS Code | A "**Dependencies could not be installed**" error appears the while extension is **finishing installation** on first start or you get errors about **missing or already present files**. | Verify you are on a **good network connection**. If you are, you could be running into a **proxy or firewall** issue. See [connectivity troubleshooting](#connectivity). <br /><br />|
| VS Code | Installing the Visual Studio Live Share extension from the marketplace <strong>installs it in the stable/insiders version of VS Code</strong> instead of the version I want. | Start VS Code stable or insiders depending on your preference, click on the "extensions" tab, search for "Visual Studio Live Share" and install from there. |
| VS Code (**Linux**) | The Live Share extension does not activate and **no status bar items appear** after installing the extension on **Linux**. | Visual Studio Live Share depends on .NET Core 2.0 which has a number of Linux prerequisites that may not be met on certain distributions of Linux by default. See [here for details](reference/linux.md#install-linux-prerequisites) on what should be installed. |


## Sign in

The following are troubleshooting tips for sign in problems.

| Tool | Problem | Resolution / Workaround |
|------|---------|------------|
| VS | You need to sign into Visual Studio Live Share with a <strong>different identity</strong> than you use to sign into Visual Studio. | Go to Tools > Options > Live Share > User account to select an alternate account. |
| VS Code | While a browser window pops up during sign in and the process <strong>appears to succeed on the web page</strong>, the status bar <strong>still says, "Sign in"</strong> after closing the browser. | After signing in, click "Having trouble?" and follow the directions to enter a temporary user code into the tool.<br /><br />We would also love to see what might be happening, so please [log a bug](https://aka.ms/vsls-problem). |
| All | You are getting a <strong>timeout or connection error</strong>. | See [connectivity troubleshooting](#connectivity). |
| All | When signing in using a Microsoft backed **work or school email address** you see a message saying, **"Need admin approval"**. | Your Azure AD tenet is setup to require “admin consent” for new applications accessing the contents of the directory. See [here](reference/security.md) for more details. |
| VS Code (**macOS**) | When signing in you see an error stating **SecKeychainAddGenericPassword() failed**. | This is almost always due to a common problem with macOS where password changes are not reflected in the login keychain. Try going into "Keychain Access", locking the login keychain and then unlocking it again. This may be enough to resolve the problem, but if you are unable to unlock it with your current password, try your previous one. If that works, change the login keychain password to your current password. See [here](https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/mac-keychain-password-kyca1242/mac) for details. |
| VS Code (**Linux**) | When entering in the user code after signing in via the browser you see an error stating **secret_password_store_sync() failed with error code XX**. | This is typically due to `gnome-keyring` and/or `libsecret-1-0`/ `libsecret` not being installed. You can validate gnome-keyring is properly configured by installing `seahorse` and then using the "Passwords and Keys" application in your desktop environment. Read more about [Linux prerequisites here](reference/linux.md#install-linux-prerequisites). |
| VS Code (**Linux**) | You are <strong>prompted to enter a user code</strong> with Live Share v0.3.295 or below, but no browser appears to allow you to get one. | We are working to eliminate the user code requirement on Linux. In the mean time, a browser window should appear for you to use to sign in. If not, the browser window may be hidden under VS Code. See the next tip if this is not the case.  |
| VS Code | After clicking "Sign in" (or using the "Live Share: Sign in" command), <strong>no browser window appears to allow you to enter your credentials</strong>. | 1. [Sign in here](https://insiders.liveshare.vsengsaas.visualstudio.com/auth/login)<br />2. After signing in, click "Having trouble?"<br /> 3. Follow the directions to enter a temporary user code into the tool. |
| All | You would like to <strong>join</strong> a collaboration session</strong> but <strong>have not / do not want to receive email updates</strong>. | Signing in to the Live Share extension in VS/VS Code does <strong>not</strong> opt you into receiving email updates.<br /><br />Live Share requires guests to sign in as a security measure so the host has visibility to the identity of those that have joined. [Up vote this feature](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/3) if you'd like the option to allow anonymous users to join (e.g. users with no name / a user defined name). |

## Share and Join

The following are troubleshooting tips for share and join problems.

| Tool | Problem | Resolution / Workaround |
|------|----------------|------------|
| All | <strong>Share/Join:</strong> You are getting a timeout or error about not being able to connect. | See [connectivity troubleshooting](#connectivity). |
| VS Code | <strong>Join:</strong> You were <strong>not prompted / able to launch VS Code</strong> after opening the join page in a browser. |  Tips: <ul><li>Be sure you've <i>started the VS Code at least once and waited for the install to complete in the status bar.</i></li><li>If that doesn't work, try running the "Live Share: Launcher Setup" command.</li><li>**Linux users**: If prompted to enter your admin (sudo) password when running the above command, please do so.</li><li>Finally, see [joining manually](reference/manual-join.md) as a workaround.</li></ul> If you hit this problem, we would love to see what might be happening, so please [log a bug](https://aka.ms/vsls-new-issue). |
| VS | <strong>Join:</strong> You were <strong>not prompted / able to launch VS </strong> after opening the join page in a browser. |  See [join manually](reference/manual-join.md).<br /><br /> We would also love to see your logs, so please [log a bug](https://aka.ms/vsls-problem) using Visual Studio's "Report a Problem..." feature. |
| All | <strong>Join:</strong> You would prefer to <strong>paste the join link directly into Visual Studio / VS Code</strong> rather than clicking on the web link. | See [join manually](reference/manual-join.md). |
| All | <strong>Join:</strong> You see a message saying, "**the owner of the workspace seems to be offline**," when joining via the browser. | Possible workarounds:<br /><ul><li>Try [joining manually](reference/manual-join.md). We have seen issues with cross-region (e.g. east and west US) joins due to service issues that do not affect manual joins.</li><li>Live Share may be unable to route directly to the host when running in "auto" connection mode. Try [relay mode](reference/connectivity.md).</li></ul>See [connectivity troubleshooting](#connectivity) for more possibilities |
| VS Code | <strong>Join:</strong> You joined via the browser <strong>before signing in</strong>, were not prompted to sign in</strong>, and the join never completed. |  This is a [known bug](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/167). Click the sign in status bar item to sign in and then join again. |
| VS Code |  <strong>Share/Join:</strong> Nothing happens when you click the "Share" and "Join" buttons. | Run the command __> Live Share: Repair Installation__ in the command palette.

## Connectivity

The information below can help you troubleshoot if you're having problems related to connectivity or timeouts when signing in, sharing, or joining.

As outlined in the [connectivity requirements for Live Share](reference/connectivity.md) article, different connection modes have different requirements to function so there are a few different potential issues going on.

| Tool | Problem | Probable Cause |
|------|------|----------------|
| All | You are using a <strong>proxy</strong> and are seeing a number of connectivity problems | Proxy settings can be tricky.  Try setting the **HTTP_PROXY** and **HTTPS_PROXY** environment variables **globally** and then restarting your tool. See [proxy settings](reference/connectivity.md#proxies) for more details. There are likely some configurations we do not yet support, so [let us know](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/86) if this does not work for you. |
| VS Code | After installing the extension and starting up VS Code for the first time you get an <strong>an error when "Finishing Installation" appears in the status bar</strong>. |  You cannot access the internet or access to download.visualstudio.microsoft.com and/or download.microsoft.com on port 443 is blocked by your personal or corporate firewall. See [here](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/58) for information on why Live Share needs to download something at this point. |
| All | You are <strong>unable to sign into Visual Studio Live Share</strong> | You cannot access the internet or access to *.liveshare.vsengsaas.visualstudio.com on port 80/443 is blocked by your personal or corporate firewall. Enter https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/ in a browser and verify you land at the Visual Studio Live Share home page. |
| All | You are in <strong>auto mode</strong> (the default), are able to sign in, but see a <strong>timeout or connection error</strong> when either sharing or joining. | Either both direct and relay modes are failing to connect or there is a bug with auto mode. If you are able to connect after [switching to direct or relay mode](reference/connectivity.md#changing-the-connection-mode), please [raise a bug](https://aka.ms/vsls-problem). |
| All | You are in <strong>direct mode</strong>, are able to sign in, but see a <strong>timeout or connection error</strong> when either sharing or joining. | The guest and host cannot directly connect. Try [auto or relay mode](reference/connectivity.md#changing-the-connection-mode) to see if the problem goes away. You may need to [manually allow Live Share through your personal firewall](reference/connectivity.md#manually-adding-a-firewall-entry) or simply use relay mode. |
| All | You are in <strong>relay mode</strong>, are able to sign in, but are notified of a <strong>timeout or connection error</strong> when either sharing or joining. | Access to *.servicebus.windows.net on port 80/443 is blocked by your personal or corporate firewall. Try [direct mode](reference/connectivity.md#changing-the-connection-mode). |

See the [connectivity requirements for Live Share](reference/connectivity.md) article, for more information on connectivity requirements.
