# Welcome to the Visual Studio Live Share preview!

If you're here, you've probably been **accepted into the private limited preview**! If not, see how to **[join an existing collaboration session](welcome-joiner.md)** with **no registration required** or **[sign up now](https://aka.ms/vsls-signup)** and when accepted into the preview you can share!

Team collaboration should be so quick and natural, that it becomes harder not to do it! For this reason, Visual Studio Live Share makes it simple to get started, so that you can seamlessly begin sharing your work and ideas.

Just follow these steps to start sharing:

### 1. Download and install Visual Studio Live Share

        2. Download and install the VS Live Share extension from the marketplace. <br />

By downloading and using Visual Studio Live Share, you agree to the [license terms](https://aka.ms/vsls-license) and [privacy statement](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement/EnterpriseDev/default.aspx). See [troubleshooting](https://aka.ms/vsls-troubleshooting) if you run into problems.

### 2. Sign in from within your IDE/editor

Once installed, start up your tool sign in with the **credentials that are associated with the email you used to sign up**. 

![VS Download](media/vs-sign-in-button.png) ![VS Code Download](media/vscode-sign-in-button.png)

If you signed up with an email that **is not already tied to a Microsoft personal, work, or school account or a GitHub account**:
1. Add the email as a secondary address to your GitHub profile
2. Verify it
3. Sign in using GitHub
4. If this still doesn't work, email vsls-feedback@microsoft.com and we can swap your email out.

> **Tip:** Need to use a different sign-in for Visual Studio than your [personalization account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/signing-in-to-visual-studio)? Go to Tools &gt; Options &gt; Live Share &gt; User account.  


### 3. Start a collaboration session and share your content

Open a folder, project, or solution, and simply click "Share" within your tool and an invite link will be automatically copied to your clipboard. 

> **Note:** You may be asked by your desktop firewall software to allow the Live Share agent to open a port the first time you share. Accepting this is entirely optional but enables a secured "direct mode" to improve performance when the person you are working with is on the same network as you are. See [changing the connection mode](../docs/getting-started.md#changing-the-connection-mode) for details.

### 4. Send someone the invite link

Send the link over e-mail, Slack, Skype, etc. and when opened in a browser will allow them to join a collaboration session that shares contents of the folder, project, or solution you opened. 

Note that the **person you invite does not need to sign up or be accepted into the preview** and will not receive any email updates by simply signing in. The web page for the invite link contains everything they need to know to download, install needed tools, and join the collaboration session. (However, they will not be able to _create_ their own collaboration sessions until they've been accepted in the preview.)
